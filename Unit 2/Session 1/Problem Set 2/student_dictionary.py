Write a function student_directory() that takes a list of 
student_names as a parameter and returns a dictionary of students, 
where each student in student_names is a key mapped to a unique 
numerical student ID.

def student_directory(student_names):
    pass

Example Input: student_names = ["Ada Lovelace", 
                                "Tu Youyou", 
                                "Mae Jemison", 
                                "Rajeshwari Chatterjee", 
                                "Alan Turing"]
                                
Example Output: {"Ada Lovelace": 1, 
                 "Tu Youyou": 2, 
                 "Mae Jemison": 3, 
                 "Rajeshwari Chatterjee": 4,
