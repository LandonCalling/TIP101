Write a function average_book_ratings(), that calculates the average 
rating for each book in a collection. The function takes one parameter: 
a dictionary book_ratings where each key-value pair represents a book 
title and a list of its ratings, respectively. Ratings are represented 
as floating-point numbers. The function should return a new dictionary 
with book titles as keys and their average rating.

    pass

Example Input:

book_ratings = {
    "The Great Gatsby": [4.5, 3.0, 5.0],
    "To Kill a Mockingbird": [4.8, 5.0, 4.0, 4.9]
}

Example Output:

{
    "The Great Gatsby": 4.2,
    "To Kill a Mockingbird": 4.7
}
